1. Most common general purpose programing language
2.  * Dynamically typed programing language
    a = 10
    a = True
    a = 'String'
    [no need to declare the data type]
    * Easy to learn
    * Freeware and open source
    * Platform Independent
    * Portability
    * Both Procedure and Object oriented
    * Interpreter - not going to compile
        Python virtual machine take care of Syntax
        Excplicitly no compilation is required
    * Extensible -  other language code allowed use inside Python
    * Embedded - use python code in other language
    * Extensive library -
3.Functional programing lang from C
4. OOP from c++
5. Scripting Languagge from perl and Shell Script
6. Modular from Module-3
7. Syntax is derived form C and ABC language


Identifier:
Name in python is called Identifier
it may be classname,variable,fuction
a = 10    a is a Identifier
def f1()  f1 is a Identifier

_abc - then it is private
__abc - strongly it is private
__abc__ -
cash% - no Special char
123abc - should not start with no
