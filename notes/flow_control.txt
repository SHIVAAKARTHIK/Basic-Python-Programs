Flow Control:
1.Selection Statement ==> if, if-else, if-elif-else
2.iterative Statement ==> for, while
3.Transefer Statement ==> break,continue,pass

* repeat the code for every item of sequence  ==> for loop
* repeat code as long as some condition is true ==> while loop
* skip the current iteration and continue for the next iteration ==> continue
* if the loop without break then else part will execute
* no work just empty box
* garbage collector is there in python
* del ==> to delete the variable
  s1 = 'qbc'
  s2 = 'afsd'
  del s1,s2 ==>valid
  del s1[2] ==> invalid because immutable
  you can delete the variable but not part of the object
