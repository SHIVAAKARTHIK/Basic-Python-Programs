* class ==> is a blue print to construct objects
    it defines all properties and operations of objects
* objects  ==> is physical existance of a class/real world entity
* reference variable ==> which is pointing to the our object by using that we can perform operations

properties => variables
actions  => methods

Hence  class contain both variable and methods

Syntax:
  class [className]:
    '''doc String'''
    variable(properties)
    methods(actions)
