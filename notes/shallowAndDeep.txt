Cloning:
--------
l1 = [10,20,30,40]
l2 = l1
then l1 and l2 address will be same
if any changes in l1 it will reflects in l2 and vice versa
l2[2]  = 90
then :
l1 = [10,20,90,40]
l2 = [10,20,90,40]

if we have to create new object with same contents then
l2 = l1.copy()
for both l1 and l2 two different objects will be created
