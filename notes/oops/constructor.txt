constructor:
------------

1.within class to refer current  object python provide a implicit variable called self
2.self variable  is always to current object
3.self variable is the first argument for constructor and instance method
4.by using self we can declare instance variable
5.instead of self you can use any name no problem
6.we can use the self within the class not outside the class

self ==> it is implicit variable which is always to current object
        when the class object is created then con will call
        python responsible to provide 'self' variable


* constructor is a special method in python class
*

  constructor                                               method
1.name Should be __init__(self)                      1.name can be anything
2.called explicitly                                  2.not required to call explicitly
3.per object method call can be                      3.only once
 any no of times
 4.we can write business logic                       4.we have to declare and initilize instance variables
